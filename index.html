    <p><b>Albert Einstein</b></p>
    <p>"Make it as <b>simple</b> as possible, but <b>not simpler</b>."</p>
    <p>"Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think."</p>
    <hr/>

    <p><b>Doug Engelbart</b></p>
    <p>"Technology should not aim to replace humans, rather amplify human capabilities."</p>
    <hr/>

    <p><b>Alan Kay</b></p>
    <p>"In the commercial world, you have this problem that the amount of research you can do in a company is based on how well your current business is going, whereas there actually should be an inverse relationship: <b>when things are going worse, you should do more research</b>."</p>

    <p><b>Bret Victor</b></p>
    <p>"Interface matters to me more than anything else, and it always has. I just never realized that. I've spent a lot of time over the years desperately trying to think of a "thing" to change the world. I now know why the search was fruitless -- things don't change the world. <b>People change the world by using things. The focus must be on the "using", not the "thing".</b> Now that I'm looking through the right end of the binoculars, I can see a lot more clearly, and there are projects and possibilities that genuinely interest me deeply."</p>
